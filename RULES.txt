N-Back consists of a 3x3 grid in which, depending on the mode you are playing (single, dual, tri, quad or penta) you will have to call back the following parameters,
n times the value of n backwards.

Single : the position of the X
Dual : the position of the X and the sound
Tri : the position of the X, the sound and it's coulour
Quad : the position of the image (makes up two variables), the sound and coulour of the image
Penta : all of the above, with a natural number between 1-9 (the range can be increased for a higher difficulty)

Example : Single-1-Back, where the number of 'reps' is equal to 20 + n so here, 21

On the second apparition, the position of the X is equal to the previous one ! It is therefore equal and in the game, you'd have to call it by pressing "a".
On Single 2, this is the same process, but you would have to remember the first two apparitions, and recall them, etc, etc. 

Here are the rules :
  - if your accuracy is greater than 80%, your score (n) increases.
  - if your accuracy is between or equal to 50%-80%, your score remains the same.
  - if your accuracy is below 50%, your score will decrease after 3 games below 50%
  - the maximum limit for the n is 20. Although this CAN be increased in manual mode, it is discouraged becaused it is untracked. And I doubt you are going to go above
    15 in dual and up anyways lol (good luck for that)
    

The game feels incredibly weird and it is really uneasy for your brain at first, but you will rapidly adapt.
